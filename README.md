This is Cognizant's virtual experience program in Aritificial Intelligence


Background - Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA. They rely heavily on new technologies, such as IoT to give them a competitive edge over other grocery stores.

Gala Groceries approached Cognizant to help them with a supply chain issue. Groceries are highly perishable items. If you overstock, you are wasting money on excessive storage and waste, but if you understock, then you risk losing customers. They want to know how to better stock the items that they sell.

So the tasks in this program were to perform exploratory data analysis, communicate results of a machine learning model, implement algorithm production, and review algorithm performance. I've used Google Colab for this project.

Task 1- Intially a sample sales dataset csv file was provided by Gala groceries which was the sales data of 1 store across one week.I used this dataset for exploratory analysis and summarize the findings.

Task 2- The client has agreed to share more data in the form of sensor data. They use sensors to measure temperature storage facilities where products are stored in the warehouse, and they also use stock levels within the refrigerators and freezers in store. The client has provided 3 datasets, it is now our job to combine, transform and model these datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement that the business has requested. 

Task 3- Implementing Algorithm in production by python modules.
